# Tameshi-JLPT

## About the title
試し (read as "tameshi") is a Japanese word that means "trial; test". 

The JLPT is short for Japanese Language Proficiency Test. It is held in Japan and abroad to evaluate and certify Japanese-language proficiency of non-native speakers. There are five levels N5 - N1 (beginner to advanced). 

## Overview
There is an official practice book available in print in the US but it is sold at higher price and not readily available. An abridged sample test is available on the official website but it’s slow and not compatible with mobile browsers, in addition the question bank for abridged version is also static and doesn’t change. A full sample test is also available on the site but the sections are formatted in PDF and audio files only.

## The Goal of this Project
The main feature of the app is to simulate a genuine test-taking experience. The user should able to practice questions to become familiar with the formatting of the test, as well as, a general self-assessment of their skills to pinpoint any areas they’d like to strengthen. The user should also be given instant feedback without relying on outside translation tools.
